# 段落匹配题
阅读**最关键**的永远是**找关键词**，段落匹配题先看它为什么类型（如**example**、**reference**、**comparison**等等），再去找后面相关联的词，例如C17-1-2的第一题`a mention of negative attitudes towards stadium building projects`，*mention*就是类型，*negative attitudes*则是关键词，此时找到关键词后，进行**联想**，想象`negative attitudes`会在文中表达什么？例如*对stadium building projects持怀疑态度、认为stadium building projects在某些方面不好*等等。此时就可以在文中找关键词，例如从原文Section A开始找：
`Stadiums are among the oldest forms of urban architecture: vast stadiums where the public could watch sporting events were at the centre of western city life as far back as the ancient Greek and Roman Empires, well before the construction of the great medieval cathedrals and the grand 19th- and 20th-century railway stations which dominated urban skylines in later eras.Today, however, stadiums are regarded with growing scepticism. Construction costs can soar above £1 billion, and stadiums finished for major events such as the Olympic Games or the FIFA World Cup have notably fallen into disuse and disrepair.But this need not be the case. History shows that stadiums can drive urban development and adapt to the culture of every age. Even today, architects and planners are finding new ways to adapt the mono-functional sports arenas which became emblematic of modernisation during the 20th century.`
在该片段中，可以看到一个`however, stadiums are regarded with growing scepticism.`其中scepticism就是怀疑态度，**关键词**便找到了，然后往下继续找，可以看到`Construction costs can soar above £1 billion, and stadiums finished for major events such as the Olympic Games or the FIFA World Cup have notably fallen into disuse and disrepair`这个就是怀疑（消极态度）。此时这道题便可以选A了。
# 单选题&填空题
仍然是先找题目的**关键字**，学会**定位关键字**非常重要！若出现明确的**数字、时间、地点**这种就是特别明显的关键字。其次，易错区是你定位到关键词在文中，然后只**往下**找，但是答案很有可能出现在时间的**上文**。以及XX of XX，其中后面XX很有可能就是填空题的答案。
